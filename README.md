# Task 1: AES Encryption & Integrity Check
**Implementation Steps:** 

•	Key Derivation: A 256-bit AES key is generated from a user-provided password using SHA-256 or MD5.

•	AES Encryption: Messages are encrypted using AES-256 in CBC mode with a randomly generated IV (Initialization Vector).

•	Integrity Check: The encrypted message is hashed using SHA-256/MD5, and both the encrypted message and hash are stored in a JSON file.

•	Decryption Process: The integrity hash is verified before decrypting the message. If the hash does not match, the program alerts the user of possible tampering.

Test Results:
Encryption Success:

An encrypted JSON file is created with the information below.
{"username": "foundationofprivacy6413", 
"iv": "6+SiNAUBD1Ohfw7vxLr86A==", 
"encrypted_message": "oawEJlG30UbF2WC3BR5qvYWmtrpkL7zCzHLX3uck7JY=", 
"hash": "b630e283fb916c2c2a8939fa249437dd7812fdca41b5d48f904504292ce6e8d7"}

After decrypting with the same username and password I get the below output.

# Task 2: SHA-256 Hash Verification of Private Key
**Implementation Steps:**

1.	Read the private_key.pem file.
2.	Compute the SHA-256 hash of the key’s contents.
3.	Compare the computed hash with provided hash values.
4.	Print whether the hash matches or not.

# Task 3: RSA Decryption of Ciphertext
Implementation Steps:
•	Read the encrypted message from encrypted_message.txt.
•	Load Alice's private key from private_key.pem.
•	Decode the encrypted message (Base64).
•	Decrypt the message using RSA (PKCS1_OAEP).
•	Print the original message.
